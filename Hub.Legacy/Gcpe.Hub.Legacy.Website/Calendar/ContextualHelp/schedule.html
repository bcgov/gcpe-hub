<p>
    Indicate <b>when</b> this item will (or may) occur. For <b>TBC placeholders</b>, the start of any date range should be the earliest possible date it ‘might’ happen. Refresh or update regularly until confirmed.
</p>

<p class="helpFieldTitle">Start and End Times</p>
    Leave the 8am-6pm default settings as is until an exact start time is known (confirmed or tentative). For “All Day” items, click both the All Day box AND the Date Confirmed box.
<p>

    <!-- <p class="helpFieldTitle">Date (Time) Confirmed</p>
        If the start and end date are the same, only the time needs to be confirmed.
    <p>-->
    <!--<p class="helpFieldTitle">Potential Dates</p>
       This is used to convey when an activity will occur in a general sense (e.g: summer, fall) which is mainly used to support the 30/60/90 report. The Potential dates field should be cleared when an activity is narrowed down. Please ensure it aligns with the start and end date, and use the scheduling considerations field for any further considerations.
    <p>-->

<p class="helpFieldTitle">Scheduling Considerations and Approval Notes</p>
<p>
    Where applicable, explain details and status ie. who has approved something to proceed or to be issued; what time frame is being requested; what may be holding it up, and so on. Be candid.
    <br />
    Examples:
    <br />
    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; MO approved to issue; needs content sign-off. Date/time confirmed with CC.</span>
    <br />
    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; MO & HQ Events approved to proceed on this date and time.</span>
    <br />
    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; MO aiming for late fall; waiting on TB approval.</span>
    <br />
    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Date/time confirmed by third-party organizers.</span>

<!--Schedule – advises what date and time activity is being planned, considered or preferred; and if it is confirmed.
Start Date & End Date	Select the planned date, or expected date range during which the activity may occur (report or policy review being released). Once solidified, update to confirmed date.
Start Time & End Time	Leave as default until planned time. Once solidified, and confirmed with HQ, update to the expected and/or confirmed date.
All day Activity	Use this for Awareness Days/Weeks/Month.  Releases or events occurring during these should be entered separately with the specific day and time of the release.
Date Confirmed?	Default remains as unconfirmed until updated by user.  Ensure Start and End dates are accurate prior to selecting Date confirmed. Note: if same day event, this becomes time confirmed.

Time Confirmed?	For releases, IBs etc., once the date is confirmed, select the Confirmed radio button, only once it has been confirmed by HQ / Writing Group.-->
